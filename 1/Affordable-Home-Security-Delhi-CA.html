<p>Commercial-grade cameras fix this issue with an unique light-handling feature. These cameras utilize both a software and hardware service called HDR, which stand for High Dynamic Range". In our example here, HDR takes a direct exposure of the space and an exposure of the doorway and then integrates the two images together to develop a properly-exposed composite picture of the 2 areas. As far as anybody is worried, the image looks totally typical since the doorway and room appear to be at the same brightness level. As an outcome, faces are correctly exposed at the door and in the shop, accomplishing the goal of recording video of everyone entering the shop. HDR is now a basic function in commercial cameras.
