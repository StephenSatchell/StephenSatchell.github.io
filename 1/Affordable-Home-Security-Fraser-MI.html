<p>Thanks to recent developments in innovation, wireless security systems are now as reliable as wired systems If you've made the decision to install a burglar alarm, you should consider the following benefits of wireless innovation. The $260 Basics package consists of the base station, a keypad, four entry sensors, one motion sensing unit, a backyard sign, and two window decals. For $15 monthly, you can add 24/7 professional monitoring and a cellular connection, so the system can communicate with the monitoring service without a landline.
