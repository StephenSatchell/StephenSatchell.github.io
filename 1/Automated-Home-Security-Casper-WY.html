<p>I simply finished updating all of my stock annke cameras with this design. The crucial distinction with this bullet camera is it has a horizontal modification which allows you to fine-tune the field of vision 1000% much better than a camera without a horizontal adjustment. No idea why more bullet cameras do not have this really essential function. Also great metal construction. Needed to hold the button down for 5 seconds to the left to get appropriate mode not in black and white. Had to make the wire hole a little bigger to fit the substantial selection device into the wall. Need to be a much better method to carry out that. But it was simply a little notch so not an offer breaker. Great resolution - better field of view vs the stock annke cameras and better clearness at night. Ideally these hold up throughout the years! Highly recommend.</p>

<p>Nurse calling systems normally consist of emergency situation buttons or pull strings within the patient's restroom.
