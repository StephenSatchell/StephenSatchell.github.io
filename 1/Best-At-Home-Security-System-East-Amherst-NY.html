<p>Developing a safe and secure  environment for a commercial or home is the obligation of the entire community. Storage capability: For video recorders, the first question you need to ask yourself is just how much storage you will need. The answer depends upon a couple of factors: the variety of cameras in your system, each camera's resolution, the quantity of archived video footage you plan to save and the length of time you plan to keep taped footage. The video footage is going to eat up storage space quickly if there are numerous cameras shooting in a higher resolution. You can set a video recorder to "overwrite" the oldest video once you reach the system's capability, but if you're not cautious, the system may overwrite archived video footage that you still require.</p>
