The essential distinction with this bullet camera is it has a horizontal modification which permits you to tweak the field of vision 1000% better than a camera without a horizontal change. No idea why more bullet cameras do not have this really important function. Likewise great metal construction. Had to hold the button down for 5 seconds to the left to get appropriate mode not in white and black. Needed to make the wire hole a little larger to fit the substantial selection device into the wall. Should be a better method to carry out that. However it was just a little notch so not a deal breaker. Great resolution - far better field of vision vs the stock annke cameras and better clearness at night.
