<p>I just finished upgrading all of my stock annke cameras with this model. The key distinction with this bullet camera is it has a horizontal change which enables you to tweak the field of vision 1000% better than a camera without a horizontal adjustment. No clue why more bullet cameras do not have this extremely crucial function. Also nice metal building. Needed to hold the button down for 5 seconds to the left to get right mode not in black and white. Needed to make the wire hole a little larger to fit the substantial selection device into the wall. Should be a much better way to execute that. However it was just a little notch so not a deal breaker. Very good resolution - better field of view vs the stock annke cameras and far better clarity during the night. Ideally these hold up throughout the years! Extremely recommend.</p>
