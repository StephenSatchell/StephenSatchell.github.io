I am extremely satisfied with this product! The cameras were much better than anticipated and I love the convenience of being able to inspect it from my phone while I'm not home.</p>
<p>At $24.99 monthly, SimpliSafe's top-tier package is still very economical compared to the other companies on this list. It's almost a steal. The Interactive package includes more control to the SimpliSafe system with mobile gain access to and both text and email notices.

<p>The Arlo Pro 3 is good but not excellent-- and so it isn't worth paying two times the cost of its predecessor. When the two are compared side by side, the Arlo Pro 3 does edge out the Pro 2 on battery life and image, with 2K HDR video that is sharper during day and nighttime viewing. However, color night vision image quality is frustrating, and the motion tracking feature is a bit wonky. Also, the Pro 3 provides no free storage, and external storage can't be seen through the app, just through a computer. We will keep monitoring the Arlo Pro 3, however for now, we still think the Arlo Pro 2 is a better buy. Both are still better than the costly Arlo Ultra, which we found to have dreadful night-vision efficiency, bad battery life, and a propensity to miss out on far too many motion triggers.</p>
