However, to conserve that battery power, recordings max out at just 10 seconds, with the system leaving a gap of between 12 seconds and 35 seconds from one clip to the next. Likewise, the Blink doesn't provide you geofencing or two-way communication, and its 720p image was a bit fuzzy in darker areas.

<p>Neither the camera nor the light is particularly impressive by itself. The Maximus Smart Security Light camera is HD, however it's only 720p-- and we're beginning to anticipate 1080p, if not 4K, from the security camera industry.
