<p>The Alarm Systems & Intrusion Detection item category is a collection of news, product listings and other resources for security experts looking into Alarm Systems & Intrusion Detection items. We thought about both the TP-Link Kasa Spot (KC100) and the Kasa Camera (KC120) for among our top areas. Nevertheless, neither model has geofencing, and the KC120 left spaces of approximately 25 seconds in between recordings. The Spot can record up to 3 minutes without spaces in between clips, but entries were often missing, regardless of showing up in the app's activity timeline. With standard clever home devices like automatic door locks, you can stay in bed and examine that you locked your doors. And a video doorbell lets you look out for would-be bundle burglars or speak with visitors who stop by.</p>
