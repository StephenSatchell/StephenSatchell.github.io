<p>CCTV surveillance equipment is a deterrent versus vandalism, theft, and fraud. Tip: Often keyholders are not available and the alarm does not reset. If the alarm is malfunctioning and reactivates, we need to again react to the alarm; each reaction is billed. Having a keyholder readily available to reset the alarm is one method of removing pricey incorrect alarms.

We ought to keep in mind that the camera would periodically downgrade the image quality based on readily available bandwidth, which might vary throughout the day.
