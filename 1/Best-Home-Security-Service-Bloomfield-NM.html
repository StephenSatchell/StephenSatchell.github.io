We love that the system includes a wifi security camera and just notifies you when motion is developed by something with the exact same heat pattern as a human (making sure there's no false alerts). However, you do require to subscribe to the external monitoring service (from â‚¤ 12.99 each month) to be able to see recording from the wifi security camera and get informs on your phone if the sensors have actually been activated.
