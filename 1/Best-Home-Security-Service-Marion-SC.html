<p>I simply completed updating all of my stock annke cameras with this model. The crucial distinction with this bullet camera is it has a horizontal adjustment which permits you to tweak the field of vision 1000% much better than a camera without a horizontal modification. No idea why more bullet cameras do not have this very essential function. Also great metal building. Needed to hold the button down for 5 seconds to the delegated get proper mode not in white and black. Had to make the wire hole a little bigger to fit the substantial selection device into the wall. Should be a much better way to implement that. But it was just a little notch so not a deal breaker. Great resolution - better field of vision vs the stock annke cameras and far better clarity at night. Ideally these hold up throughout the years! Extremely recommend.</p>

Nest's Secure has the best design of any system I checked, consisting of creative things like incorporating the keypad and a motion detector into the base station and combining motion detectors and entry sensors into one unit.
