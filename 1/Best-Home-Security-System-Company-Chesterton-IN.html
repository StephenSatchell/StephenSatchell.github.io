<p>Studies reveal surveillance cameras reduce criminal activity. HD CCTV systems are compatible with conventional analog CCTV cameras. If you purchased cameras before 2010 or if you have coax cable (look at the cable behind the TELEVISION that goes to the cable box) in your existing security system that means you have standard analog CCTV security cameras. If you buy HD-CCTV security system, you can upgrade your existing analog CCTV security system without sacrificing your coax facilities. That's simply $0.63 a day (or about $19 a month) for the House Iota All-in-One security camera, an additional contact sensor, and a remote key fob.

<p>What is a thermal camera, and where might you want one? Here is a short explanation of how thermal cameras work: All things produce infrared energy (heat) as a function of their temperature level.

A thermal camera consists of a heat sensor that is capable of finding tiny distinctions in temperature level. The device collects the infrared radiation from objects in the scene and produces an electronic image based on information about the temperature level distinctions. Due to the fact that things are rarely specifically the exact same temperature as other items around them, a thermal camera can spot them, and they will appear as unique in a thermal image.</p>
