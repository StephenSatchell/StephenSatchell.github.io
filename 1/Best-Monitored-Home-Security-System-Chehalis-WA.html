<p>Discover how to design, build, and install commercial grade security camera systems to increase worker safety and minimize crime. The Ring Floodlight Webcam integrates two important devices in one: A home security camera and a motion-activated floodlight. When the Floodlight camera discovers motion, it turns on its 2 effective LED beams as well as its sharp 1080p camera, and begins recording. The Floodlight Webcam also has a loud speaker, so you can speak to whoever's in front of the camera, and hear their responses.

This also depends on the provider, but you can anticipate signing a contract with companies who require expert installation of their systems. The average length of a home security contract is 36 months or 3 years. On the greater end, some agreements could cover as much as 60 months or 5 years. We would recommend thinking about a DIY home security system instead if you desire to avoid having to sign a contract.</p>
