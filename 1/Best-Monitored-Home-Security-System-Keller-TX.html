<p>I simply ended up updating all of my stock annke cameras with this model. The crucial distinction with this bullet camera is it has a horizontal adjustment which enables you to tweak the field of vision 1000% better than a camera without a horizontal modification. No idea why more bullet cameras do not have this extremely essential function. Also good metal building and construction. Had to hold the button down for 5 seconds to the left to get right mode not in black and white. Needed to make the wire hole a little bigger to fit the huge choice gadget into the wall. Must be a much better way to execute that. But it was simply a little notch so not a deal breaker. Great resolution - better field of vision vs the stock annke cameras and far better clarity in the evening. Hopefully these hold up over the years! Highly advise.</p>
