<p>The NVR gets rid of these problems, because it is rather connected straight to a network. IP cameras that are linked to the very same network, typically by way of a PoE switch, are then able to transfer video to the NVR. Systems based around an NVR are a lot easier to scale up than DVR systems, merely since they can accept a new camera once it is added to the network. In the worst case, all that would be needed is an additional PoE switch. Some IP cameras are likewise wireless and can transmit video footage to the NVR over Wi-Fi. There are no distance constraints so long as a camera is linked to the very same network as the NVR. The largest downside to an NVR system, nevertheless, is that not every IP camera will work with every NVR.
