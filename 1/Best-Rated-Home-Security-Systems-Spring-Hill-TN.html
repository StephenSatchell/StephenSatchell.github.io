<p>So, while alarm might have some benefit for alarm owners as part of an overall security plan, the question stays whether non-alarm owners in the neighborhood need to take on a share of the cost. If alarm usage led to boosted public safety-- that is, alarms caused much greater burglar apprehension rates or, preferably, less thefts throughout an entire jurisdiction-- its public value would be more apparent. Nevertheless, the fact that alarm calls are extremely incorrect and do not contribute substantially to police ability to nab intruders makes the underwriting of alarm reaction by authorities and whole communities (all taxpayers support cops response to alarmed residential or commercial properties) a costly and ineffective  technique to break-in reduction across an entire jurisdiction.</p>
