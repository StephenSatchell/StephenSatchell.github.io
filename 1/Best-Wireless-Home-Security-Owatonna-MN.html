<p>I just completed updating all of my stock annke cameras with this design. The essential difference with this bullet camera is it has a horizontal change which allows you to tweak the field of vision 1000% much better than a camera without a horizontal adjustment. No idea why more bullet cameras do not have this very crucial feature. Also nice metal building and construction. Had to hold the button down for 5 seconds to the delegated get proper mode not in white and black. Had to make the wire hole a little bigger to fit the huge selection device into the wall. Need to be a much better way to implement that. However it was just a little notch so not a deal breaker. Very good resolution - far better field of view vs the stock annke cameras and much better clarity in the evening. Ideally these hold up throughout the years! Extremely recommend.</p>
