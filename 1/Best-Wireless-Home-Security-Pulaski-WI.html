When the two are compared side by side, the Arlo Pro 3 does edge out the Pro 2 on battery life and image, with 2K HDR video that is sharper throughout day and nighttime watching. However, color night vision image quality is disappointing, and the motion tracking function is a bit wonky. Likewise, the Pro 3 provides no free storage, and external storage can't be viewed through the app, only by means of a computer system.

Both are still better than the expensive Arlo Ultra, which we discovered to have dreadful night-vision efficiency, poor battery life, and a tendency to miss far too many motion sets off.</p>
