<p>The growing existence of public cameras will bring extensive however subtle changes to the character of our public spaces.

You don't wish to upset them or otherwise call attention to yourself." Ultimately, he cautions, "individuals might find out to be careful about the regulars and books they read in public, avoiding titles that may alarm unseen observers.
