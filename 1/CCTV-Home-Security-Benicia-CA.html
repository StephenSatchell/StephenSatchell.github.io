<p>Unlike most other cameras we evaluated, the corded Circle 2 does not have level of sensitivity settings for motion detection (though the cordless model does ). Instead, you can filter occasion alerts just by high activity, days, or individual (the latter is offered just with a paid Circle Safe membership). Without a paid Circle Safe membership, you'll get more notifies, which you can only filter to receive every minute, 15 minutes, or thirty minutes. The membership is better when used in high-traffic locations. Otherwise, the Smart Place feature can be set to disable recording when you're home-- to avoid informs every time you walk by.
