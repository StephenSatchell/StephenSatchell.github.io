Instead, you can filter occasion alerts just by high activity, days, or person (the latter is readily available only with a paid Circle Safe membership). Without a paid Circle Safe membership, you'll get more signals, which you can just filter to receive every minute, 15 minutes, or thirty minutes. When utilized in high-traffic locations, the subscription is more beneficial. Otherwise, the Smart Location feature can be set to disable recording when you're home-- to prevent informs each time you walk by.
