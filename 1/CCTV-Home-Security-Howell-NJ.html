<p>CCTV surveillance equipment is a deterrent versus theft, scams, and vandalism. Recommendation: Typically keyholders are not available and the alarm does not reset. We should again respond to the alarm; each response is billed if the alarm is malfunctioning and reactivates. Having a keyholder available to reset the alarm is one way of getting rid of expensive false alarms. For instance, if the carbon monoxide gas levels increase past a specific level, you can make it immediately switch off the heating unit. If the motion sensors are set off, you can automatically make the smart lights turn on to frighten prospective robbers.</p>

The Maximus Smart Security Light camera is HD, but it's just 720p-- and we're beginning to expect 1080p, if not 4K, from the security camera industry. With that stated, we would not recommend this system to tech-lovers, as we believe the functions are a little too basic. For instance, we would have liked to see an outdoor camera and more clever home functions. However if easy DIY installation, no-contracts, and low-cost monitoring is your thing, we believe you'll enjoy SimpliSafe.</p>
