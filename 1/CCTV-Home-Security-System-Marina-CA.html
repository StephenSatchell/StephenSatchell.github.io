<p>The growing presence of public cameras will bring subtle but profound modifications to the character of our public areas. When people are being enjoyed by the authorities - or aware they might be seen at any time - they are more self-conscious and less free-wheeling. As syndicated writer Jacob Sullum has pointed out, "knowing that you are being enjoyed by armed federal government agents tends to deter things. You don't want to offend them or otherwise call attention to yourself." Eventually, he warns, "people may discover to be cautious about the periodicals and books they read in public, avoiding titles that might alarm unseen observers. They might also put more thought into how they dress, lest they appear like terrorists, gang hookers, members or drug addicts."
