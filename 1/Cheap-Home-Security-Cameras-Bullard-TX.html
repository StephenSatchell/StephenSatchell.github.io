<p>There are two main kinds of cameras that can be wired into a video surveillance system: web protocol (IP) cameras and the traditional analog cameras. IP cameras are the more modern-day model of analog cameras, and while the specific cameras tend to be a little bit more expensive, they use a number of functions that analog cameras do not.
