<p>So, while alarm may have some advantage for alarm owners as part of an overall security plan, the question stays whether non-alarm owners in the community should take on a share of the cost.

However, the truth that alarm calls are overwhelmingly incorrect and do not contribute significantly to authorities ability to collar burglars makes the underwriting of alarm response by cops and entire communities (all taxpayers support police response to alarmed homes) a expensive and inefficient  method to robbery decrease throughout an entire jurisdiction.</p>
