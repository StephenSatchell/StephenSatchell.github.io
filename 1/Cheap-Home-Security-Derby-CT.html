As far as anyone is concerned, the image looks totally normal since the doorway and space seem at the very same brightness level. As an outcome, faces are properly exposed at the door and in the store, achieving the goal of recording video of everybody entering the shop. HDR is now a standard function in commercial cameras. Sadly, when clients understand that the inexpensive consumer camera they bought is lacking HDR, it's generally too late since the recorders and cameras are installed.</p>
