<p>The Google Nest Webcam IQ Outdoor is the most highly sophisticated outdoor camera we've evaluated. It has a close-up tracking function, which automatically zooms in on motion and after that follows it around the field of view.

It can distinguish between basic motion and individuals, so it cuts down on incorrect alarms, and it can even identify people you've labeled (after a learning period).

Recordings are recorded as 10-second clips that are saved for as much as 24 hours, unless you pay the $8 month-to-month charge (or $80 annually) to save 30-second clips for 1 month. Beyond those limits, we frequently discovered action missing, thanks to prolonged and irregular spaces in between recordings. Likewise, the camera itself gets exceedingly hot.</p>
