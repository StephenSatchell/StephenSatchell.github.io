<p>On the surface, these two camera classifications may appear similar, though if you had the ability to see inside, the differences end up being obvious and distinct. Commercial-grade cameras are created and built for high-performance applications where failure is not a choice; consumer-grade cameras are not. Normally, consumer-grade cameras are constructed to work well when there is lots of readily available light, and when the lighting ends up being absent or low (think sundown or nighttime), their pedigree starts to show. Commercial cameras outperform their less expensive cousins due to the fact that they have bigger internal video sensors and higher-quality components that can adjust and capture excellent low light video.</p>
