<p>So, while alarm systems might have some advantage for alarm owners as part of an overall security bundle, the question remains whether non-alarm owners in the neighborhood must shoulder a share of the cost.

Nevertheless, the reality that alarm calls are overwhelmingly false and do not contribute considerably to police ability to collar burglars makes the underwriting of alarm response by cops and whole communities (all taxpayers subsidize cops reaction to alarmed residential or commercial properties) a pricey and ineffective  method to robbery decrease throughout a whole jurisdiction.</p>
