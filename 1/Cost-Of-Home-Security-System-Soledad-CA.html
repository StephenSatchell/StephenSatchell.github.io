<p>Developing a safe and secure  environment for a commercial or home is the duty of the entire community. Storage capacity: For video recorders, the very first question you need to ask yourself is just how much storage you will require. The answer depends upon a number of aspects: the variety of cameras in your system, each camera's resolution, the amount of archived footage you plan to keep and the length of time you prepare to keep taped video footage. If there are numerous cameras shooting in a greater resolution, the footage is going to consume storage space rapidly.

<p>I just completed upgrading all of my stock annke cameras with this model. The essential difference with this bullet camera is it has a horizontal change which enables you to tweak the field of vision 1000% much better than a camera without a horizontal adjustment. No idea why more bullet cameras do not have this extremely essential feature. Also nice metal building and construction. Needed to hold the button down for 5 seconds to the left to get right mode not in black and white. Needed to make the wire hole a little bigger to fit the big choice device into the wall. Need to be a better method to carry out that. However it was just a little notch so not a deal breaker. Very good resolution - much better field of vision vs the stock annke cameras and much better clearness during the night. Hopefully these hold up over the years! Highly recommend.</p>
