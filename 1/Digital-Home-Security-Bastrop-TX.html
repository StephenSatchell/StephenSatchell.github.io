<p>A system that requires a contract may be a wise choice for those who are cash-strapped or don't wish to spend for the equipment up-front. Why? Since contract-based security systems typically don't included upfront fees. Rather, the costs are expanded over the length of the contract. We have actually seen 1-year, all the method as much as 5-year agreements! On the other hand, we recommend contract-free systems if you do not wish to sign on the dotted line and be locked into a long-lasting contract (and who does?). Our pick: No contract.</p>
