<p>The Canary is one of the largest cameras we checked, and it uses two-way communication with its paid Canary Subscription. The cost of the Canary View makes the size a bit more palatable, but the image isn't as sharp, and recording wasn't consistent during our testing. The Netatmo Invite does not have two-way audio or digital zoom, and it constantly asked us to acknowledge already-identified faces. And in spite of having an appealing price and good efficiency, the Yi 1080p Home Camera has confusing cloud storage that includes $65 to $150 annually to the cost of an otherwise budget plan camera.</p>
