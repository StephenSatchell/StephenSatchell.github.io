<p>Think of it this way, if a good still-camera costs a minimum of two hundred and fifty dollars (United States $), how can a more advanced camera be sold for the low price of forty dollars? It simply does not build up. To provide such low prices, producers must cut corners, and the end result is jeopardized efficiency.

<p>In August 2019, the LockPickingLawyer YouTube channel published a video demonstrating how to hack into a SimpliSafe system utilizing a $2 remote. SimpliSafe reacted with a declaration stating the system would signal users when it identified any type of interference. The company also questioned the video, declaring that there would need to be an ideal storm of circumstances for someone to effectively hack the system. Over a week, we ran more than 25 tests using two different 433 MHz remotes, with contact sensing units situated 6 to 26 feet away from the SimpliSafe Base Station, and we were unable to reproduce the concern. Although our screening should not be taken as definitive, we believe this issue is not likely to be a real-world issue for SimpliSafe customers who own the present system.</p>
