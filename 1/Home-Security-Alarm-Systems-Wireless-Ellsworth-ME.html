<p>Unlike most other cameras we tested, the corded Circle 2 does not have sensitivity settings for motion detection (though the cordless design does ). Instead, you can filter occasion alerts just by high activity, days, or individual (the latter is offered only with a paid Circle Safe subscription). Without a paid Circle Safe membership, you'll get more alerts, which you can only filter to receive every minute, 15 minutes, or 30 minutes. When used in high-traffic areas, the subscription is more beneficial. Otherwise, the Smart Place feature can be set to disable recording when you're home-- to prevent signals each time you walk by. Unusually, though the app supports multiple users, its geofencing uses to each user individually, so if everybody in your household has the Circle app installed, you'll still get notices when other people are home.</p>
