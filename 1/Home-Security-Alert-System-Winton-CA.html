<p>I simply finished updating all of my stock annke cameras with this model. The essential distinction with this bullet camera is it has a horizontal change which enables you to modify the field of vision 1000% better than a camera without a horizontal modification. No hint why more bullet cameras do not have this really crucial function. Also good metal building and construction. Needed to hold the button down for 5 seconds to the left to get proper mode not in black and white. Needed to make the wire hole a little bigger to fit the big selection gadget into the wall. Should be a better method to execute that. But it was just a little notch so not an offer breaker. Excellent resolution - better field of view vs the stock annke cameras and much better clearness during the night. Ideally these hold up over the years! Highly advise.</p>
