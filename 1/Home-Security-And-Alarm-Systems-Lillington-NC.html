<p>Our SSA security system was set up at our new home on Friday, June 23rd. Ron Thompson was our sales specialist. He supplied the recommendations concerning what was required for our home and was on-site for the installation. Darek managed the installation and arrived right on time. He talked to us concerning placement of some of the monitoring devices in our home. He also assisted me in filling the app and completing the online set-up process. He also examined the new keypad performance. Both Darek and Ron were very expert and helpful. Thanks.</p>
<p>Wireless home security systems require batteries. Therefore, you will need to examine and alter the batteries regularly, which takes more cash, time, and effort. They may claim your security company has failed, that they have actually taken over the accounts, and that you need to buy new equipment and sign new agreements. If this occurs, call your current monitoring company to validate. Generally, you would be notified of a change like this by mail or telephone, not by an unannounced visit by an agent from another company.</p>
<p>This is the best-scoring wise alarm we evaluated. It was very basic to establish, as the parts are pre-paired to the base station, and it was quick to trigger when any of the sensing units were activated. We like that it comes with both external and internal sirens and will even work with Philips Hue wise lights, too. The directions are exceptionally thorough and the 200m variety of the alarm suggests it can be used to protect sheds and garages as well as your home. The alarm system doesn't consist of a wifi security camera but you can purchase a variety of various Yale cameras that will deal with the alarm as optional extras. There's no external monitoring alternative with this alarm.</p>
