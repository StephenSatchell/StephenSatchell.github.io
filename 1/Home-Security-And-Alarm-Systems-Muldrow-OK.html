Here is what this indicates, by way of an example. Presume 2 cameras, one a standard camera with a 130 ° field of view and the other a 720 ° camera, and both cameras are high-resolution 10MP (megapixel) designs. This indicates the 720 ° camera has far less resolution per square inch; it is beginning with the very same image sensing unit, 10MP in this case, though it has to spread that image across a far larger space and therefore will not look as crisp of a camera that just has a 130 ° field of vision.</p>
<p>There's a few other cool features in the camera itself such as an automatic zoom which tracks moving objects if it detects an intruder; a handy intercom function that permits the gadget to serve as a smart doorbell (although it doesn't have a chime or button - for that you'll need the Nest Hello doorbell ); and, because Alphabet owns Nest, the camera brings Google Assistant.
