<p>I simply finished updating all of my stock annke cameras with this design. The key difference with this bullet camera is it has a horizontal change which permits you to modify the field of vision 1000% better than a camera without a horizontal modification. No idea why more bullet cameras do not have this very essential function. Likewise good metal building and construction. Had to hold the button down for 5 seconds to the left to get appropriate mode not in black and white. Had to make the wire hole a little larger to fit the substantial selection device into the wall. Must be a much better way to implement that. However it was simply a little notch so not a deal breaker. Very good resolution - far better field of view vs the stock annke cameras and better clarity during the night. Ideally these hold up for many years! Highly advise.</p>
