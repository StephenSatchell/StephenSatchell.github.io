Techniques consisted of searches of electronic bibliographic databases, manual searches of CCTV evaluation study bibliographies, forward searches of CCTV examinations, and contacting leading researchers to ask about upcoming evaluations. Both published and unpublished reports were included in the search, which was not limited to the English language and was global in scope.</p>
