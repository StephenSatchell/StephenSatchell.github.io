<p>The remainder of the field is more specialized, accommodating innovative wise home connoisseurs or fans of a particular ecosytem of products. Nest's Secure has the very best design of any system I evaluated, consisting of smart things like integrating a motion and the keypad detector into the base station and combining motion detectors and entry sensing units into one unit. But the Secure is pricey, extra sensing units are pricey, and the monitoring service-- which doesn't consist of fire alarms or camera backups-- is also pricey if you do not dedicate to a three-year contract.</p>

These cameras hold true 1080p and work completely right out of package. They are well aligned and focused. The clarity is actually fantastic. Night vision holds true 1080p at around 40ft, but still can see pretty good after that. These cameras are what you require to buy, and don't go cheap.</p>
