<p>The growing presence of public cameras will bring subtle however profound changes to the character of our public areas. When citizens are being enjoyed by the authorities - or mindful they may be viewed at any time - they are more uneasy and less free-wheeling. As syndicated columnist Jacob Sullum has mentioned, "knowing that you are being watched by armed government representatives tends to deter things. You do not wish to anger them or otherwise call attention to yourself." Eventually, he warns, "people may learn to be careful about the regulars and books they check out in public, avoiding titles that might alarm unseen observers.
