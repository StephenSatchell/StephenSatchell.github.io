<p>The Arlo Pro 2 is an easy-to-use outdoor Wi-Fi camera that's compact and can be used hardwired or entirely wirelessly-- the latter thanks to a detachable, rechargeable battery that, based on our testing, must provide a minimum of a number of months of operation on a charge (depending on usage). The Arlo Pro 2 is likewise the only cord-free 1080p camera on our list that uses seven days of totally free cloud storage (with more available for a regular monthly cost ). However, the camera will reset the sensing unit in between recordings, which Arlo states will enable the camera to effectively discover motion and not get stuck taping on a loop. That likewise saves battery life, however it might leave you with tape-recording gaps during important security events.
