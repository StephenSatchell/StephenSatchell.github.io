<p>The NVR removes these issues, because it is rather linked straight to a network. IP cameras that are connected to the very same network, normally by way of a PoE switch, are then able to transfer footage to the NVR. Systems based around an NVR are a lot easier to scale up than DVR systems, merely since they can accept a new camera once it is contributed to the network. In the worst case, all that would be needed is an additional PoE switch. Some IP cameras are also wireless and can send video footage to the NVR over Wi-Fi.

"When the criminal offense and offense figures were adapted to take account of the general down trend in crimes and offences," criminologists discovered in one study, "decreases were noted in certain categories however there was no proof to recommend that the cameras had actually reduced crime overall in the city centre."
