<p>The DoS attack in itself does little to expose organizational information to a destructive attacker, since the disturbance of the network avoids the flow of data and in fact indirectly safeguards data by preventing it from being transferred. The usual factor for performing a DoS attack is to observe the healing of the wireless network, during which all of the preliminary handshake codes are re-transmitted by all devices, offering a chance for the malicious opponent to tape-record these codes and utilize various cracking tools to analyze security weaknesses and exploit them to gain unapproved access to the system. This works best on weakly encrypted systems such as WEP, where there are a number of tools offered which can launch a dictionary design attack of "potentially accepted" security secrets based on the "design" security essential caught during the network healing.</p>
<p>No matter what type of alarm you have, a lot of burglar alarms work the exact same method. They use open and closed circuits to transfer an electrical current. When this electrical current is not being transferred it triggers an alarm system. In closed circuit security systems, the electrical current is moved when the doors are shut. Which means if the doors are shut electrical current can be moved throughout the circuits. Which would then set off the burglar alarm if somebody were to open the door that would imply that the electrical current can no longer be moved. However, in an open circuit security system, opening the door permits the electrical current to flow throughout the system, which means when the doors are shut the burglar alarm will set off.</p>
