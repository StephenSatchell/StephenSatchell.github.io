<p>I just completed upgrading all of my stock annke cameras with this design. The crucial distinction with this bullet camera is it has a horizontal modification which enables you to fine-tune the field of view 1000% much better than a camera without a horizontal change. No clue why more bullet cameras do not have this very important feature. Likewise nice metal construction.

Should be a much better way to implement that. However it was simply a little notch so not a deal breaker. Very good resolution - far better field of view vs the stock annke cameras and better clearness at night. Hopefully these hold up over the years! Extremely advise.</p>
