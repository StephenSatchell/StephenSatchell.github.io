<p>The rest of Nest's security equipment is premium, if not especially revolutionary, so we're actually suggesting the security cameras here. Some small-business owners will also like Nest's contract-free plan option. Sure, you get a lower cost if you opt for a three-year agreement, however because Nest needs you to pay 100% of your remaining agreement if you cancel, it's a huge commitment. So pick what will be the better offer for you. Go with the contract and enjoy those cost savings if you understand you'll stay put for at least 3 years.
