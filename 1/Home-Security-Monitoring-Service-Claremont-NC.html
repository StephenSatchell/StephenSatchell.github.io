<p>I simply ended up upgrading all of my stock annke cameras with this model. The crucial distinction with this bullet camera is it has a horizontal modification which allows you to modify the field of view 1000% much better than a camera without a horizontal change. No idea why more bullet cameras do not have this really crucial feature. Also great metal construction. Needed to hold the button down for 5 seconds to the left to get correct mode not in white and black. Needed to make the wire hole a little larger to fit the huge selection gadget into the wall. Should be a much better way to execute that. But it was just a little notch so not an offer breaker. Very good resolution - much better field of view vs the stock annke cameras and far better clarity at night. Hopefully these hold up for many years! Highly recommend.</p>
