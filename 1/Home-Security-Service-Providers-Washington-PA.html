Just a couple years back, the home security industry was controlled by a few big names offering expensive, rigid plans with little flexibility and hostile, long-term contracts. Systems were restricted to a couple wired motion sensing units connected to a keypad control panel and run through a landline. Nowadays, this has actually all altered.</p>
