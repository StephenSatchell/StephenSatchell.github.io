<p>The Arlo Pro 2 is an easy-to-use outdoor Wi-Fi camera that's compact and can be utilized hardwired or completely wirelessly-- the latter thanks to a detachable, rechargeable battery that, based upon our screening, ought to supply a minimum of a couple of months of operation on a charge (depending upon usage). The Arlo Pro 2 is also the only cord-free 1080p camera on our list that uses 7 days of complimentary cloud storage (with more offered for a monthly charge ). However, the camera will reset the sensor in between recordings, which Arlo states will permit the camera to appropriately identify motion and not get stuck tape-recording on a loop.
