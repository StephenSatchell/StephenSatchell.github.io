<p>Twenty-five years ago, general and business interactions were primarily synchronous. To accomplish almost anything, someone live" needed to be on the other side of the table or telephone line, specifically when dealing with worldwide and national business.

<p>Neither the light nor the camera is particularly excellent on its own. The Maximus Smart Security Light camera is HD, but it's only 720p-- and we're beginning to expect 1080p, if not 4K, from the security camera market.
