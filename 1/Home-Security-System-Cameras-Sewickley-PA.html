<p>Get best-in-class security, plus clever home automation the whole family will like. ADT is a household name, so we regularly check out their systems to guarantee they're still up-to-task.

<p>Smart home alarm systems use an added layer of benefit in the way they connect to your phone or computer, which might come together with some major downsides.

But while SimpliSafe has less customer care accessibility, it uses monetary versatility that ADT does not match.
