<p>The Arlo Pro 3 is not excellent but good-- therefore it isn't worth paying two times the rate of its predecessor. When the 2 are compared side by side, the Arlo Pro 3 does edge out the Pro 2 on battery life and image, with 2K HDR video that is sharper throughout day and nighttime viewing. However, color night vision image quality is disappointing, and the motion tracking feature is a bit wonky. Likewise, the Pro 3 uses no free storage, and external storage can't be viewed through the app, just through a computer. We will keep monitoring the Arlo Pro 3, however for now, we still think the Arlo Pro 2 is a better buy.

<p>So, while alarm might have some advantage for alarm owners as part of a total security package, the question stays whether non-alarm owners in the community should carry a share of the cost. If alarm usage led to boosted public safety-- that is, alarms caused much higher burglar apprehension rates or, preferably, less robberies across a whole jurisdiction-- its public value would be more evident. However, the reality that alarm calls are overwhelmingly false and do not contribute substantially to cops capability to capture intruders makes the underwriting of alarm reaction by authorities and entire communities (all taxpayers support cops action to alarmed properties) a ineffective and costly approach to break-in reduction across an entire jurisdiction.</p>
