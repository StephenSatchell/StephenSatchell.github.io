The Netatmo Invite does not have two-way audio or digital zoom, and it continuously asked us to recognize already-identified faces.

If you have a large yard or outbuildings to safeguard, this system may not be the best fit.

But you can connect the Q with other Arlo outdoor and indoor cameras in the Arlo app, which is offered for iOS, Android, Fire OS, and any Web internet browser. Aside from providing easy access to recordings, the app permits you to change level of sensitivity so that you're not getting signals every 2 minutes.</p>
