<p>Closed circuit television (CCTV) surveillance is a form of situational crime prevention developed to prevent both individual and property criminal offense and can be used in location of, or in addition to, police. Public surveillance cameras monitor, record, and transfer images of a particular area of interest and are either monitored remotely by security personnel or preprogramed to scan the specified area (La Vigne et al. 2011). It is believed that the increased surveillance offered by CCTV will reduce crime and increase arrest, without displacing crime to other nearby areas where CCTV is not in use (Ratcliffe 2009).</p>

<p>There are two outdoor security camera designs - dome or bullet-shaped.
