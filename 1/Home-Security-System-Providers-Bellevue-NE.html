<p>I simply finished updating all of my stock annke cameras with this model. The essential distinction with this bullet camera is it has a horizontal adjustment which allows you to modify the field of vision 1000% better than a camera without a horizontal adjustment. No idea why more bullet cameras do not have this really crucial function. Also good metal building and construction. Needed to hold the button down for 5 seconds to the left to get appropriate mode not in white and black. Had to make the wire hole a little larger to fit the substantial selection gadget into the wall. Need to be a better method to execute that. However it was simply a little notch so not a deal breaker. Very good resolution - far better field of view vs the stock annke cameras and much better clarity during the night. Hopefully these hold up throughout the years! Highly recommend.</p>
