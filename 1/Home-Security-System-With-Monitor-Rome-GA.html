<p>Commercial-grade cameras fix this issue with a special light-handling feature. These cameras use both a software application and hardware service called HDR, which mean High Dynamic Range". In our example here, HDR takes an exposure of the space and a direct exposure of the entrance and then combines the two images together to create a properly-exposed composite image of the 2 areas. As far as anyone is concerned, the image looks entirely normal since the doorway and room seem at the very same brightness level. As an outcome, faces are effectively exposed at the door and in the shop, accomplishing the goal of recording video of everyone entering the shop. HDR is now a basic function in commercial cameras. Regrettably, as soon as clients understand that the affordable consumer camera they purchased is doing not have HDR, it's normally far too late given that the recorders and cameras are installed.</p>
