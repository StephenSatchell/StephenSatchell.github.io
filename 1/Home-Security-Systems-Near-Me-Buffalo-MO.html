<p>The Nest Camera Outdoor's 1080p images and noise were impressive in our testing-- throughout the day and during the night-- with a broad, 130-degree field of vision and 8 x digital zoom that allowed us to get a closer view in live video.

<p>The loudest of the smart alarm we tested, the Somfy Home Alarm Video does a good task at alerting anybody in your house and those close-by that there's a problem. Throughout testing, the siren was quick to sound when any of the sensing units were activated and we love that the level of sensitivity of the motion sensor can be gotten used to represent family pets, too. The alarm is just one of two we tested that includes an external siren, and we're amazed that it also includes a dummy siren that can be connected to another external wall, even more discouraging anybody from trying to break in to your residential or commercial property. We checked Somfy's more expensive system, which came with a wifi security camera, however more economical sets are likewise available. In spite of the significant price here, there's no external monitoring alternative.</p>

<p>I simply ended up upgrading all of my stock annke cameras with this design. The crucial difference with this bullet camera is it has a horizontal change which enables you to modify the field of vision 1000% much better than a camera without a horizontal change. No clue why more bullet cameras do not have this extremely important function. Also nice metal construction. Needed to hold the button down for 5 seconds to the left to get appropriate mode not in white and black. Had to make the wire hole a little larger to fit the big choice gadget into the wall. Must be a better way to execute that. However it was simply a little notch so not an offer breaker. Excellent resolution - much better field of vision vs the stock annke cameras and much better clarity at night. Ideally these hold up over the years! Highly recommend.</p>
