<p>Commercial-grade cameras resolve this issue with a special light-handling feature. These cameras use both a software application and hardware option called HDR, which stand for High Dynamic Range". In our example here, HDR takes a direct exposure of the room and a direct exposure of the entrance and then integrates the 2 images together to create a properly-exposed composite image of the two locations. As far as anybody is worried, the image looks totally typical considering that the entrance and room seem at the same brightness level.

<h3>Basic Home Alarm System Newburgh NY 12550</h3>

For example, you can have a smart plug turn on a lamp inside your home or trigger an external siren when the camera discovers motion.</p>
