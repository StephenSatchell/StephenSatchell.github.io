Nest Aware subscriptions are priced per camera, and if you wish to pull out of paying for storage completely, Nest only offers you up to three hours worth of recordings. Wired security systems are linked by hard-wired cables and require access to power outlets, making them more difficult to place and install.

<p>The Nest Webcam Outdoor's 1080p images and sound were remarkable in our screening-- during the day and at night-- with a large, 130-degree field of vision and 8 x digital zoom that enabled us to get a closer view in live video. We should keep in mind that the camera would occasionally downgrade the photo quality based on offered bandwidth, which might vary throughout the day. Nest includes the option to set the bandwidth to low, medium, and high, but that may beat the purpose of having a 1080p camera.</p>

<p>The Arlo Pro 3 is good but not terrific-- therefore it isn't worth paying two times the cost of its predecessor. When the two are compared side by side, the Arlo Pro 3 does edge out the Pro 2 on battery life and image, with 2K HDR video that is sharper throughout day and nighttime viewing. Nevertheless, color night vision image quality is frustrating, and the motion tracking feature is a bit wonky. Also, the Pro 3 offers no complimentary storage, and external storage can't be seen through the app, only via a computer. We will keep monitoring the Arlo Pro 3, but for now, we still think the Arlo Pro 2 is a much better buy. Both are still better than the expensive Arlo Ultra, which we found to have dreadful night-vision efficiency, poor battery life, and a propensity to miss out on far a lot of motion activates.</p>
