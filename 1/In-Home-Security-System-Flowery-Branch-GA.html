<p>Commercial-grade cameras resolve this issue with a special light-handling feature. These cameras use both a software application and hardware option called HDR, which mean High Dynamic Range". In our example here, HDR takes a direct exposure of the room and a direct exposure of the doorway and after that integrates the 2 images together to create a properly-exposed composite picture of the two areas. As far as anyone is worried, the image looks entirely normal given that the entrance and space seem at the same brightness level. As a result, faces are correctly exposed at the door and in the shop, accomplishing the objective of catching video of everyone getting in the shop. HDR is now a basic feature in commercial cameras. Sadly, when consumers recognize that the low-cost customer camera they purchased is lacking HDR, it's usually far too late considering that the recorders and cameras are set up.</p>
