Part of that is due to the fact that ADT has more consumers than many brands-- which means it has more opportunities to encounter issues. But part of it is the method ADT sells its equipment. When a company deals with several dealers and providers, its consumers are going to get a broad series of experiences. Some will be good, and some will be bad.</p>
<p>Unlike a lot of other cameras we checked, the corded Circle 2 does not have sensitivity settings for motion detection (though the cordless design does ). Rather, you can filter event notifications only by high activity, days, or person (the latter is readily available just with a paid Circle Safe subscription). Without a paid Circle Safe subscription, you'll get more notifies, which you can just filter to receive every minute, 15 minutes, or 30 minutes. When utilized in high-traffic areas, the membership is more helpful. Otherwise, the Smart Location feature can be set to disable recording when you're home-- to avoid notifies each time you stroll by. Unusually, though the app supports several users, its geofencing uses to each user separately, so if everybody in your family has the Circle app installed, you'll still get notifications when other people are home.</p>

<p>For an outdoor camera that does more than record video and send out notifies, make certain it works with other clever devices.

For example, you can have a clever plug turn on a lamp inside or activate an external siren when the camera spots motion.</p>
