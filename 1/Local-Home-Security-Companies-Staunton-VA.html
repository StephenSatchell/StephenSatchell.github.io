<h3>Wireless Surveillance Camera System Staunton VA 24401</h3>
<p>Linking analog cameras with a DVR system is done by way of directly plugging a BNC cable television from the DVR into the camera. To link more cameras to the DVR system, you need extra cable televisions. DVR systems are hard to scale up due to the fact that when every BNC connection is occupied by a camera, you need to buy a completely new DVR prior to including another camera to the system. DVRs also require that the linked cameras remain in close proximity to the recorder; otherwise, the video quality begins to break down.</p>
