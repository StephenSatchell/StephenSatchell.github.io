You can generally modify the camera's motion level of sensitivity to prevent incorrect alarms due to family pet activity or passing cars and trucks if the camera is near a window, and you can produce a schedule that turns the sensing units on and off during certain hours of the day.</p>

<p>So, while alarm may have some advantage for alarm owners as part of a general security package, the concern remains whether non-alarm owners in the neighborhood must carry a share of the cost. If alarm use resulted in enhanced public safety-- that is, alarms caused much higher burglar apprehension rates or, ideally, less thefts across an entire jurisdiction-- its public worth would be more apparent.
