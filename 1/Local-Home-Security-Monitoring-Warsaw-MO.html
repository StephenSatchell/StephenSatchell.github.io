<p>CCTV surveillance equipment is a deterrent against scams, vandalism, and theft. Tip: Typically keyholders are not available and the alarm does not reset. We must once again react to the alarm; each response is billed if the alarm is malfunctioning and reactivates. Having a keyholder available to reset the alarm is one method of removing expensive false alarms. For instance, if the carbon monoxide levels increase past a particular level, you can make it automatically turn off the heater. If the motion sensing units are set off, you can immediately make the clever lights turn on to frighten possible intruders.</p>
