<p>So, while alarm systems may have some benefit for alarm owners as part of a general security bundle, the concern remains whether non-alarm owners in the community should shoulder a share of the cost. If alarm use led to enhanced public safety-- that is, alarms led to much greater burglar apprehension rates or, preferably, fewer robberies throughout an entire jurisdiction-- its public value would be more apparent. Nevertheless, the reality that alarm calls are overwhelmingly incorrect and do not contribute significantly to authorities capability to nab burglars makes the underwriting of alarm response by cops and entire communities (all taxpayers support police response to alarmed properties) a ineffective and expensive method to theft reduction throughout a whole jurisdiction.</p>
<p>For smart home functions, we advise the ADT Pulse plan.
