<p>I just ended up updating all of my stock annke cameras with this model. The crucial distinction with this bullet camera is it has a horizontal adjustment which allows you to modify the field of vision 1000% much better than a camera without a horizontal change. No idea why more bullet cameras do not have this extremely crucial function. Also great metal building. Needed to hold the button down for 5 seconds to the delegated get right mode not in black and white. Needed to make the wire hole a little larger to fit the huge choice device into the wall. Must be a better way to execute that. However it was just a little notch so not a deal breaker. Very good resolution - far better field of vision vs the stock annke cameras and much better clarity in the evening. Ideally these hold up throughout the years! Highly advise.</p>
