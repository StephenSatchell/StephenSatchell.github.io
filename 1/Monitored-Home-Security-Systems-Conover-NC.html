Storage capability: For video recorders, the first concern you need to ask yourself is just how much storage you will need. The answer depends upon a number of aspects: the variety of cameras in your system, each camera's resolution, the amount of archived video footage you intend to store and for how long you prepare to keep recorded video footage. The video is going to eat up storage space quickly if there are lots of cameras shooting in a greater resolution.
