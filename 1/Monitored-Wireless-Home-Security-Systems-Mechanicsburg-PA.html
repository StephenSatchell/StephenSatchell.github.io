You do not want to offend them or otherwise call attention to yourself." Ultimately, he cautions, "individuals may find out to be careful about the regulars and books they read in public, preventing titles that may alarm unseen observers. They may likewise put more believed into how they dress, lest they look like terrorists, gang members, drug addicts or hookers."
