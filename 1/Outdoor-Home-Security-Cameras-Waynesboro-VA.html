<p>Unlike most other cameras we evaluated, the corded Circle 2 does not have sensitivity settings for motion detection (though the cordless model does ). Instead, you can filter occasion alerts only by high activity, days, or individual (the latter is available just with a paid Circle Safe membership). Without a paid Circle Safe subscription, you'll get more alerts, which you can just filter to receive every minute, 15 minutes, or thirty minutes. The subscription is more useful when utilized in high-traffic locations. Otherwise, the Smart Location feature can be set to disable recording when you're home-- to avoid notifies each time you walk by.
