<p>With state-of-the-art burglar alarm systems from Security Instrument, you and your household will have the very best defense possible from break-ins and theft. For instance, no other company can monitor a SimpliSafe, Cox, Brinks Home, or Xfinity Home system. These companies designed their equipment by doing this to make clients stick with them longer, since changing monitoring companies means hundreds of dollars down the drain and a huge headache for customers. How did they do it? They placed 5 routers, DVRs and IP cameras on the open web. They were all running their latest software application and firmware. According to the report, one device was hacked within a couple of minutes, while the rest were done and cleaned within a day. They didn't say which gadget was the first, and the last to fall, though.</p>
