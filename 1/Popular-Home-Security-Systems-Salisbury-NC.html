<p>Thank you for your feedback, Don. We've found that battery life never ever matches the producer's stats given that this comes from tests in a regulated environment without continuous video recording, which is the most significant perpetrator for brief battery life by far. We agree with you about Blink's exceptional battery life over on our outdoor security camera review, but its recording capacity is a bit limited to suggest as a top pick.</p>
<p>SimpliSafe may be too limited for you if you have a larger home or home you desire to keep an eye on. The only outdoor security camera that's presently available is the Video Doorbell Pro, which is terrific for keeping an eye on visitors and plan shipments, but it leaves other parts of your lawn vulnerable. This system may not be the best fit if you have a large lawn or sheds to secure. Unlike the outdoor Arlo cameras, the Arlo Q does not need a base station-- it links directly to any Wi-Fi network. But you can link the Q with other Arlo indoor and outdoor cameras in the Arlo app, which is offered for iOS, Android, Fire OS, and any Web browser. Aside from offering easy access to recordings, the app permits you to change level of sensitivity so that you're not getting alerts every 2 minutes.</p>

You'll also pay more for professional installation through ADT than you would through Vivint, particularly for cameras. And to be sincere, we're not awfully impressed by ADT's cameras in the first location. What you're paying for is mostly that huge name in blue.</p>
