The crucial difference with this bullet camera is it has a horizontal modification which enables you to tweak the field of view 1000% much better than a camera without a horizontal adjustment. No hint why more bullet cameras do not have this extremely important feature. Likewise nice metal building and construction. Needed to hold the button down for 5 seconds to the delegated get right mode not in white and black. Needed to make the wire hole a little larger to fit the big choice gadget into the wall. Need to be a much better way to execute that. But it was just a little notch so not an offer breaker. Very good resolution - much better field of view vs the stock annke cameras and better clarity during the night. Ideally these hold up throughout the years! Highly suggest.</p>
