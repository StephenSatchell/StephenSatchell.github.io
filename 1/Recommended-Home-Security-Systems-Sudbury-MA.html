<p>Get best-in-class security, plus smart home automation the entire household will enjoy. ADT is a household name, so we regularly try out their systems to guarantee they're still up-to-task. In our most current round of screening, we understood that ADT is the most popular provider for a factor. We believe their home protection + home automation + video packages are nipping at the heels of Vivint. That is, they made us feel secure in our home and kept us plenty busy with cool smart home features. We specifically liked the ADT Pulse App and controls.</p>

<p>Scout Alarm ties with Ring for the most cost-efficient monitoring plan beginning at $10.

This extra cost isn't perfect, however when compared to the Frontpoint and Vivint $40-and $45- particular minimum prices per month for monitoring, Scout Alarm is a take.</p>
<p>The Arlo Pro 3 is good however not excellent-- and so it isn't worth paying two times the cost of its predecessor. When the 2 are compared side by side, the Arlo Pro 3 does edge out the Pro 2 on battery life and image, with 2K HDR video that is sharper during day and nighttime watching. However, color night vision image quality is disappointing, and the motion tracking function is a bit wonky. Also, the Pro 3 offers no totally free storage, and external storage can't be viewed through the app, only via a computer system. We will keep monitoring the Arlo Pro 3, but for now, we still think the Arlo Pro 2 is a better buy. Both are still better than the costly Arlo Ultra, which we found to have dreadful night-vision performance, poor battery life, and a propensity to miss out on far too many motion sets off.</p>
