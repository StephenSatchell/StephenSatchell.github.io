Without a paid Circle Safe membership, you'll get more notifies, which you can just filter to receive every minute, 15 minutes, or thirty minutes. When utilized in high-traffic locations, the subscription is more beneficial. Otherwise, the Smart Place feature can be set to disable recording when you're home-- to prevent signals whenever you stroll by. Unusually, though the app supports numerous users, its geofencing applies to each user separately, so if everybody in your family has the Circle app installed, you'll still get notifications when other people are home.</p>
