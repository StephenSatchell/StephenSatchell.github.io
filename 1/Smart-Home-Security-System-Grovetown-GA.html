<p>I simply ended up upgrading all of my stock annke cameras with this design. The essential difference with this bullet camera is it has a horizontal change which enables you to tweak the field of view 1000% much better than a camera without a horizontal change. No clue why more bullet cameras do not have this really essential function. Also good metal building. Needed to hold the button down for 5 seconds to the left to get proper mode not in white and black. Needed to make the wire hole a little larger to fit the huge selection gadget into the wall. Should be a better method to execute that. However it was just a little notch so not a deal breaker. Very good resolution - much better field of view vs the stock annke cameras and far better clearness during the night. Hopefully these hold up over the years! Extremely recommend.</p>
