<p>Besides resolution, likewise consider the field of vision. All security cameras have wide-angle lenses, but not all angles are developed equal.

By ordinance, only incorrect alarms triggered by cyclones, twisters, earthquake or other disastrous occasions, are subject to appeal.

<p>Unlike most other cameras we checked, the corded Circle 2 does not have level of sensitivity settings for motion detection (though the cordless design does ). Instead, you can filter event notices only by high activity, days, or person (the latter is readily available just with a paid Circle Safe membership). Without a paid Circle Safe membership, you'll get more notifies, which you can only filter to get every minute, 15 minutes, or thirty minutes. When used in high-traffic locations, the membership is more useful. Otherwise, the Smart Area function can be set to disable recording when you're home-- to avoid informs whenever you walk by.
