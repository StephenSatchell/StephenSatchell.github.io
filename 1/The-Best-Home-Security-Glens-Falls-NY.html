<p>Although 360 ° and 720 ° cameras may have the exact same resolution spec as that of a basic IP camera, that resolution is being spread over a much wider area and for that reason offers fewer pixels per inch. Here is what this indicates, by method of an example. Assume 2 cameras, one a standard camera with a 130 ° field of vision and the other a 720 ° camera, and both cameras are high-resolution 10MP (megapixel) designs. This suggests the 720 ° camera has far less resolution per square inch; it is beginning with the same image sensing unit, 10MP in this case, though it has to spread that image across a far bigger space and therefore will not look as crisp of a camera that only has a 130 ° field of vision.</p>
<p>The Logi Circle app, available for iOS and Android and as a Web app, is simple to browse. Events are displayed on a timeline of bubbles off to the side of the screen. And if scanning through all of those events is too tedious, the app has a Day Quick function that condenses alerts into a 30-second emphasize reel. Settings allow you to customize the frequency of notifies and include a Smart Location geofencing feature, so the camera will not be firing off signals when you are home. The Circle 2 can also be integrated with Apple HomeKit, Google Assistant, and Amazon Alexa, as well as with Logitech Pop. This permits you to call camera feeds on supported devices (such as the Echo Show and Echo Area) and even control privacy features with the noise of your voice. Logitech states the Circle 2 will support HomeKit Secure Video, an end-to-end encrypted storage system using iCloud, later on in 2019.</p>
