<p>To evaluate response times for the monitoring company, we set off each system a minimum of 5 times, utilizing contact and motion sensors. Nevertheless, bear in mind that the monitoring company's response time has definitely nothing to do with the speed at which your local authorities will react to the alarm-- if they react at all. In Los Angeles, for example, all alarm calls need to be validated, either by an eyewitness or through video or audio from a surveillance camera or microphone.

Moreover, the motion sensor here is much more innovative than the ones provided by adobe Starter Package. Because it is a PIR motion sensing unit, it just gets set off when it captures motion from something releasing infrared energy, i.e., animals and people.

Customers have the choice to lease or buy the equipment (which comes with a lifetime warranty).

<p>Neither the camera nor the light is particularly outstanding by itself. The Maximus Smart Security Light camera is HD, however it's only 720p-- and we're beginning to expect 1080p, if not 4K, from the security camera industry. With that stated, we would not recommend this system to tech-lovers, as we believe the functions are a little too basic. For example, we would have liked to see an outdoor camera and more wise home features. But if easy Do It Yourself installation, no-contracts, and low-priced monitoring is your thing, we think you'll enjoy SimpliSafe.</p>
