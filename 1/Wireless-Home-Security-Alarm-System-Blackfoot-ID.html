Editor's Note: Trying to find the video surveillance system that's right for you? Fill out the questionnaire listed below, and you will be called by our partner vendors to assist find the right system for your business.

<p>This being Ring, the app is polished and professional too, and if you want to see what your camera is shooting then you can get the video up on an Echo Program or a Fire TV device with a simple Alexa voice command. I hear this all the time in my daily operations management of American Alarm Systems. If contract strategies do not interest you, think about Blue by ADT, which provides DIY installation and self-monitoring.
