<p>This being Ring, the app is polished and professional too, and if you want to see what your camera is shooting then you can get the video up on an Echo Program or a Fire TV device with a simple Alexa voice command. I hear this all the time in my daily operations management of American Alarm Systems. If contract strategies do not interest you, think about Blue by ADT, which provides DIY installation and self-monitoring.
