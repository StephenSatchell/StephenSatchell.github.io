<p>In August 2019, the LockPickingLawyer YouTube channel published a video demonstrating how to hack into a SimpliSafe system utilizing a $2 remote. When it discovered any type of disturbance, SimpliSafe reacted with a declaration saying the system would alert users. The company also questioned the video, declaring that there would need to be a best storm of circumstances for someone to successfully hack the system. Over a week, we ran more than 25 tests utilizing 2 different 433 MHz remotes, with contact sensing units located 6 to 26 feet away from the SimpliSafe Base Station, and we were not able to duplicate the concern. Although our screening should not be taken as conclusive, we believe this problem is not likely to be a real-world problem for SimpliSafe consumers who own the existing system.</p>

Recordings are captured as 10-second clips that are kept for up to 24 hours, unless you pay the $8 regular monthly fee (or $80 per year) to save 30-second clips for thirty days. Beyond those limitations, we frequently discovered action missing, thanks to lengthy and inconsistent spaces in between recordings. Likewise, the camera itself gets exceptionally hot.</p>

All of the cameras were connected to the exact same 2.4 GHz network by means of a Wi-Fi router indoors (approximately 40 feet from the cameras); service to the house was Verizon Fios.</p>
