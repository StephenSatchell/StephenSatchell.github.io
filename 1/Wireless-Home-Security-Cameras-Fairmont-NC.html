<p>Home security systems and contemporary wise home capabilities and compatibilities permit you to use their sensing units and cameras directly from your phone. Look for a design that provides a high resolution (1080p), a broad angle lens (140 to 180 degrees), a night vision range up to 25 feet, and economical cloud storage for tape-recorded video.

The typical length of a home security contract is 36 months or 3 years. On the greater end, some agreements could span approximately 60 months or 5 years. If you want to prevent having to sign an agreement, we would advise considering a Do It Yourself home security system instead.</p>
