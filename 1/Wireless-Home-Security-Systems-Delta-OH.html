We like that the system consists of a wifi security camera and only alerts you when motion is developed by something with the very same heat pattern as a human (making sure there's no incorrect signals). However, you do need to sign up for the external monitoring service (from ₤ 12.99 per month) to be able to see recording from the wifi security camera and get signals on your phone if the sensors have been activated. There's no external alarm either. Other packages are offered that have crucial fobs and extra sensors, too.</p>
