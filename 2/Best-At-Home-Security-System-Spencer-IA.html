In the London subway bombings in 2005, terrorists carried bombs onto buses and trains, detonating them during rush hour. After the terrible attacks, police examined CCTV camera video and saw the terrorists entering the train station, carrying backpacks loaded with explosives. The terrorists were tape-recorded on numerous CCTV cameras, but regrettably they were neither observed nor obstructed before they had the ability to carry out the attacks.</p>

CCTV security systems have actually been around for years and are still a reliable and proactive  security step after all these years. For those seeking to discourage criminal offense and monitor activity, CCTV security systems provide a budget friendly and trusted option.</p>
