<p>Another crucial subject to go over is camera resolution. It can be puzzling to understand how much suffices. In this short article, the term resolution" refers to the variety of dots (pixels) that make up a video image; the more dots, the more comprehensive the video image. The very same holds true of high-resolution TV sets, and the 2 most popular TELEVISION resolutions today are 1080p and 4K. 4K resolution includes about 4 times as much image details as 1080p. Surveillance cameras are likewise produced in these two resolutions, and it would be natural to believe that the more dots in your video image the much better, right? Yes and no. When it pertains to surveillance cameras, there are some difficult consequences to having such a high-resolution 4K image. In this case, more is not constantly much better.</p>
