<p>When utilizing IP cameras - as most CCTV systems do these days - you will more than likely be looking at Cat5E or Cat6 cables, which can transfer the big amount of information needed by digital video and high resolutions at extremely fast speeds, and typically over cross countries. This is an upgrade from the coax cabling that normally powers analog security cameras; coax cables are reputable, but not suitable with IP cameras. In most cases, Cat5e and Cat6 cable televisions will also power the security cameras, eliminating the need for more circuitry. When the security cameras are not connected to an NVR, this is called Power-Over-Ethernet and needs a PoE switch. Wireless security cameras may need less circuitry in the walls but will still require cables to power the security camera individually, generally via 110VAC power.</p>
