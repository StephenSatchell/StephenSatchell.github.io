Storage capacity: For video recorders, the first concern you have to ask yourself is just how much storage you will require. The answer hinges on a number of factors: the number of cameras in your system, each camera's resolution, the amount of archived footage you mean to save and how long you plan to keep taped video footage. The video footage is going to consume up storage space rapidly if there are many cameras shooting in a higher resolution. You can set a video recorder to "overwrite" the earliest video when you reach the system's capability, however if you're not mindful, the system may overwrite archived footage that you still require.</p>

<p>With a main focus and a condensed periphery, a fisheye lens security camera provides you a concentrated look at a broad field of vision. It's excellent for a parking area or a storage facility, where the finer information aren't as essential as the overall image.
