<p>The genuine reason cameras are normally deployed is to decrease much pettier criminal activities. But it has actually not even been demonstrated that they can do that.

"Once the criminal offense and offence figures were adjusted to take account of the basic downward pattern in offences and criminal offenses," criminologists found in one research study, "reductions were noted in specific categories however there was no evidence to suggest that the cameras had actually minimized criminal activity in general in the city centre."
