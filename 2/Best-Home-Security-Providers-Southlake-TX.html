<p>Commercial-grade cameras fix this issue with an unique light-handling function. These cameras use both a software and hardware solution called HDR, which mean High Dynamic Range". In our example here, HDR takes a direct exposure of the space and an exposure of the doorway and then combines the 2 images together to develop a properly-exposed composite picture of the two locations. As far as anybody is concerned, the image looks completely regular because the doorway and room appear to be at the exact same brightness level. As a result, faces are correctly exposed at the door and in the store, achieving the goal of capturing video of everyone getting in the shop. HDR is now a basic feature in commercial cameras. Sadly, as soon as customers realize that the economical consumer camera they bought is doing not have HDR, it's usually far too late since the recorders and cameras are set up.</p>
