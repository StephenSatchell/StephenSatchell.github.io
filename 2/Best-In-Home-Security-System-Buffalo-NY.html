Over 97% of home security alarms in Seattle wind up being false. That's why the Seattle Police Department (SPD) introduced its False Alarm Program in 2004. It utilizes fees and alarm registration to decrease the number of false alarms to which the department needs to react. The main intent of the program is to save the city cash and time Both fees help the city make up for that loss, and punish your company when cops are dispatched to your house just to find there's no emergency.

The majority of present cameras fall in the 130-degree range. These broad angles can in some cases trigger image distortion at the edges in the kind of a fisheye impact, especially when used in smaller sized rooms, however it's not like you're going to use a security to catch snapshots for your image album.</p>
<p>Another method to store recordings on a non-analogue media is through the use of a digital video recorder (DVR). Such a gadget is comparable in functionality to a PC with a capture card and appropriate video recording software Unlike PCs, many DVRs designed for CCTV functions are ingrained devices that need less upkeep and simpler setup than a PC-based service, for a medium to a large number of analogue cameras. Because whatever is merely stuck onto the wall and not hardwired, removing cameras, detectors, and other parts of a wireless security system and putting them up in a new place takes minutes, not days.

The system can be set up to interact by means of network or mobile app for viewing.</p>
