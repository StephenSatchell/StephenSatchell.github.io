Storage capacity: For video recorders, the first concern you have to ask yourself is how much storage you will need. The response depends upon a couple of aspects: the variety of cameras in your system, each camera's resolution, the amount of archived footage you intend to save and the length of time you prepare to keep taped footage. The video is going to consume up storage area rapidly if there are lots of cameras shooting in a greater resolution. You can set a video recorder to "overwrite" the earliest footage once you reach the system's capability, but if you're not mindful, the system might overwrite archived footage that you still need.</p>
