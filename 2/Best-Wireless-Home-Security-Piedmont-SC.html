<p>3 huge benefits of wireless security systems for tenants are their impermanence, mobility and expandability. Tenants, unlike property owners, normally prevent making permanent modifications to their homes. Hardwired security systems therefore aren't useful; they include drilling into walls and setting up permanent electrical circuits. In contrast, wireless security uses equipment that's either freestanding or attached to walls and entrances with removable adhesive. Wireless control board, sensing units and other parts can quickly be set up at various properties later on, and wireless systems are easily expanded with new components too.
