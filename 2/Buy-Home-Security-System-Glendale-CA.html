Recordings are captured as 10-second clips that are saved for approximately 24 hr, unless you pay the $8 month-to-month charge (or $80 annually) to save 30-second clips for thirty days.

Unusually, though the app supports multiple users, its geofencing uses to each user separately, so if everybody in your family has the Circle app set up, you'll still get notices when other individuals are home.</p>
