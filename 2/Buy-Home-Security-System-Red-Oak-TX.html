<p>Expert installation was practically the only method to put in a home security system 15 years earlier. Technology has come such a long way that DIY systems can provide the very same level of security (and typically more) with a self set up system.

For somebody looking for a more complex setup like home automation, or somebody that desires a trained specialist to make the recommendation for the setup, expert installation is a fantastic option. We've found that most people that were uncertain about self installing a home security system actually wound up finding the process really simple. There are companies out there like Frontpoint that are known to be especially helpful in this phase.</p>
