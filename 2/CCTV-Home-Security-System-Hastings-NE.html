<p>B. This chapter governs alarm system systems meant to summon police department workers, needs registration, assessment of charges for extreme false burglar alarms, offers treatments for repeat offenders, and provides an effective date. Whether you're utilizing a wireless IP-based system or sign up for a security element as a part of a "wise home" bundle; these innovations depend on user passwords to arm and disarm them.

If you go on trip and have somebody coming over to feed animals or inspect on your home, set a short-lived password and reset it as soon as you return. As newer security systems transition to cloud-based, wireless platforms, it is important to guard yourself versus network intrusion just as you would with protecting your identity and virtual properties online.</p>
