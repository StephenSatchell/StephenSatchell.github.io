<p>The growing existence of public cameras will bring subtle but profound modifications to the character of our public spaces. When citizens are being seen by the authorities - or mindful they may be seen at any time - they are more self-conscious and less free-wheeling. As syndicated writer Jacob Sullum has mentioned, "understanding that you are being viewed by armed government agents tends to deter things. You do not want to offend them or otherwise call attention to yourself." Eventually, he alerts, "individuals may discover to be cautious about the books and regulars they read in public, avoiding titles that might alarm hidden observers. They may likewise put more thought into how they dress, lest they appear like terrorists, gang members, druggies or hookers." Certainly, the studies of cameras in Britain found that people considered to be "out of time and place" with the surroundings underwent prolonged surveillance.</p>
<p>Twenty-five years earlier, general and business communications were primarily synchronous. To achieve practically anything, somebody live" required to be on the other side of the table or telephone line, particularly when handling national and global business.
