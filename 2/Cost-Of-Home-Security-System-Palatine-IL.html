<p>A dome CCTV camera gets its name from the dome-shaped housing that the camera sits in. Whilst these are reasonably discreet CCTV cameras in appearance, this does not stop them from discouraging lawbreakers. This is due to the fact that the dome casing makes it truly challenging for people to see which instructions the camera is pointing. This develops an air of unpredictability for prospective thieves or vandals approaching from all instructions.

When glass breaks it produces particular shock frequencies which take a trip through the glass and often through the window frame and the surrounding walls and ceiling.
