<p>3 big benefits of wireless security systems for renters are their portability, impermanence and expandability. Occupants, unlike house owners, usually prevent making long-term changes to their homes.

On the other hand, wireless security utilizes equipment that's either freestanding or affixed to walls and entrances with detachable adhesive. Wireless control panels, sensing units and other parts can easily be established at different homes later, and wireless systems are quickly broadened with new elements too. Wireless security plans also allow remote control of the system and basic home automation. If home automation is your main appeal, check out our list of top systems with home automation functions.</p>
