<p>Cameras with built in wifi that talk with an existing network should be within 300 feet for optimum efficiency. With cameras that communicate with wifi NVR's placement of the camera near the NVR is absolutely something to be thought about. For instance if the only thing blocking the NVR from a camera is a window there wouldn't be much of an issue but if there is an insulated wall in between the camera and NVR or the NVR is down stairs and the camera is installed on second story wall, this would cause a disruption in the signal.
