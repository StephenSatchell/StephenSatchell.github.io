<p>Neither the camera nor the light is particularly remarkable by itself. The Maximus Smart Security Light camera is HD, but it's only 720p-- and we're beginning to anticipate 1080p, if not 4K, from the security camera market. With that stated, we would not advise this system to tech-lovers, as we believe the functions are a little too basic. For example, we would have liked to see an outdoor camera and more wise home functions. However if simple Do It Yourself installation, no-contracts, and inexpensive monitoring is your thing, we believe you'll enjoy SimpliSafe.</p>
