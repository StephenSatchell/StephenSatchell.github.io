The latter allows you to see precisely when a particular individual reaches your home - so you'll when the kids got home from school and if they were alone, and whether the cleaner appeared on time.

Beyond those limitations, we frequently discovered action missing out on, thanks to inconsistent and lengthy spaces in between recordings. Also, the camera itself gets exceptionally hot.</p>
