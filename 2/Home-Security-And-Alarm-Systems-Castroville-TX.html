Throughout testing, the siren was quick to sound when any of the sensors were activated and we love that the level of sensitivity of the motion sensing unit can be adjusted to represent pets, too. The alarm system is just one of 2 we evaluated that consists of an external siren, and we're impressed that it also includes a dummy siren that can be attached to another external wall, even more dissuading anybody from trying to break in to your home.
