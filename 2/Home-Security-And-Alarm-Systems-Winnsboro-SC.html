We thought about both the TP-Link Kasa Area (KC100) and the Kasa Camera (KC120) for among our top spots. However, neither design has geofencing, and the KC120 left spaces of up to 25 seconds in between recordings. The Spot can tape approximately 3 minutes without gaps in between clips, but entries were often missing, in spite of appearing in the app's activity timeline.
