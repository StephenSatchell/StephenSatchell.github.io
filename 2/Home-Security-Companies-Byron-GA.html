This is also known as the logical choice theory (La Vigne et al. 2011). CCTV is likewise grounded in situational criminal offense prevention strategy, which argues that opportunities to upset can be minimized by changing a range of systems such as increasing the danger of a transgressor being nabbed, increasing the effort to devote the criminal offense, reducing benefits from criminal offense commission, and reducing justifications that generate criminal chances (La Vigne et al. 2011).
