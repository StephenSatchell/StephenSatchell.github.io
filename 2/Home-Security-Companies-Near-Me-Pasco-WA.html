<p>I just finished updating all of my stock annke cameras with this design. The key distinction with this bullet camera is it has a horizontal change which allows you to tweak the field of view 1000% much better than a camera without a horizontal adjustment. No hint why more bullet cameras do not have this really crucial function. Also nice metal building. Had to hold the button down for 5 seconds to the left to get proper mode not in black and white. Needed to make the wire hole a little bigger to fit the big choice device into the wall. Must be a better method to implement that. However it was simply a little notch so not a deal breaker. Very good resolution - far better field of view vs the stock annke cameras and far better clarity in the evening. Ideally these hold up throughout the years! Highly recommend.</p>
