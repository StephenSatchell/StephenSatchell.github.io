During our hands-on testing of Brinks, we discovered the systems to be somewhat easy to set up and use-- but not rather as simple as brands like SimpliSafe or Ring Alarm.</p>
<p>It is very important to know that the Brinks of the past isn't the exact same company as the Brinks of today. The company went through a rebranding and relabeling stage in 2009 as Broadview Security due to ownership changes.

Consider the height the alarm manufacturer recommends motion sensors should be installed at (this can be anywhere between 5ft and 8ft) to guarantee any pet's won't set off the sensing unit.</p>
