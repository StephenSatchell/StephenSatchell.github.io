<p>Professional installation was almost the only method to put in a home security system 15 years ago. Technology has actually come such a long method that DIY systems can provide the exact same level of security (and often more) with a self installed system. Even more, there can be fringe benefits to a DIY system due to the fact that they're normally much easier to transfer to another home if you move. For someone looking for a more complicated setup like home automation, or somebody that wants a trained expert to make the recommendation for the setup, professional installation is an excellent option.
