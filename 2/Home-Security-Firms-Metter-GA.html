<p>With modern alarm system systems from Security Instrument, you and your household will have the best defense possible from break-ins and theft. For example, no other company can monitor a SimpliSafe, Cox, Brinks Home, or Xfinity Home system. These companies created their equipment by doing this to make consumers stay with them longer, because changing monitoring companies indicates hundreds of dollars down the drain and a huge headache for customers.
