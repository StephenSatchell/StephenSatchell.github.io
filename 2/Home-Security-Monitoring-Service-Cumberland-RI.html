<p>Because it's more complicated than it must be, we do not recommend the SmartThings SmartCam. Recordings, alerts, and integration all require separate IFTTT-style rules. Recordings are recorded as 10-second clips that are saved for as much as 24 hr, unless you pay the $8 monthly fee (or $80 per year) to keep 30-second clips for one month. Beyond those limitations, we often discovered action missing out on, thanks to prolonged and inconsistent gaps in between recordings. Also, the camera itself gets exceptionally hot.</p>

<p>TP-Link's Kasa Web cam Outdoor (KC200) has 1080p images and a 130-degree field of vision that could rival a few of our top picks.

However, we had a handful of tests where recordings eliminated in the middle of the action and would leave 13-second gaps in between clips. Protective Systems utilizes a touch-screen control board and keypads, various sensing units (motion, glass break, smoke, carbon monoxide gas, door contacts), and surveillance cameras to monitor homes.

<p>Another important topic to talk about is camera resolution. It can be puzzling to understand just how much suffices. In this short article, the term resolution" describes the number of dots (pixels) that comprise a video image; the more dots, the more comprehensive the video image. The same holds true of high-resolution TV sets, and the two most popular TELEVISION resolutions today are 1080p and 4K. 4K resolution includes about four times as much image info as 1080p. Surveillance cameras are also manufactured in these 2 resolutions, and it would be natural to believe that the more dots in your video image the much better, right? Yes and no. There are some challenging consequences to having such a high-resolution 4K image when it comes to surveillance cameras. In this case, more is not always much better.</p>
