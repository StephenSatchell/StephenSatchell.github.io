<p>A wired security system was the first kind of security system that was created for property owners. It must be installed by an expert alarm installation team and, once set up, is tough to move from one location to another. Wired systems are more typical for big residential or commercial properties and are typically more costly than a wireless home security system. They can consist of outdoor cameras and an indoor camera just like the wireless system. In order to install the hardwired security system, the team will need to revamp the existing wires in your home.

<p>Seismic glass-break detectors, usually referred to as shock sensing units, are different in that they are set up on the glass pane. When glass breaks it produces particular shock frequencies which travel through the glass and typically through the window frame and the surrounding walls and ceiling. Typically, the most intense frequencies created are between 3 and 5 kHz, depending on the type of glass and the presence of a plastic interlayer. Seismic glass-break detectors feel these shock frequencies and in turn create an alarm condition.</p>
