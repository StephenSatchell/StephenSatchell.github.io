Without a paid Circle Safe subscription, you'll get more notifies, which you can only filter to receive every minute, 15 minutes, or 30 minutes. The subscription is more useful when used in high-traffic locations. Otherwise, the Smart Area function can be set to disable recording when you're home-- to avoid alerts each time you walk by.

<p>Blink cameras are compact, include totally free storage, and utilize two AA batteries that can last up to two years.
