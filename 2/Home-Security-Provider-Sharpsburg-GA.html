Recordings are caught as 10-second clips that are kept for up to 24 hours, unless you pay the $8 monthly charge (or $80 annually) to save 30-second clips for one month. Beyond those limits, we often discovered action missing, thanks to irregular and prolonged gaps in between recordings. Also, the camera itself gets exceptionally hot.</p>
