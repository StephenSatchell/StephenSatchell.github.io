ADT doesn't have the greatest client service track record amongst the companies we thought about, acquiring more than 3,000 complaints on its Bbb page While we chalked most of this up to the reality that ADT has several million more customers than its rivals, our tester began his call with low expectations.</p>

ADT's higher-tier strategies do cost more than a lot of other alarm companies-- plus they need a $99 installation charge-- however if you need a great deal of control over the comings and goings of your business, it's probably worth it. And since ADT provides very same- and next-day installation, you can get that additional security in no time, which looks like good bang for your buck.</p>
