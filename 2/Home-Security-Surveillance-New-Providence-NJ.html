<p>The Wi-Fi Protected Access (WPA and WPA2) security procedures were later developed to attend to the issues with WEP. If a weak password, such as a dictionary word or short character string is used, WPA and WPA2 can be split. Using a long enough random password (e.g. 14 random letters) or passphrase (e.g. 5 arbitrarily chosen words) makes pre-shared crucial WPA virtually uncrackable. The second generation of the WPA security protocol (WPA2) is based upon the final IEEE 802.11 i amendment to the 802.11 standard and is eligible for FIPS 140-2 compliance. With all those encryption schemes, any client in the network that understands the keys can check out all the traffic.</p>
