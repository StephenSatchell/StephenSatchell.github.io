The video footage is going to consume up storage area quickly if there are lots of cameras shooting in a greater resolution.

Some alarm systems are connected to video surveillance systems so that present video of the intrusion area can be quickly displayed on a remote monitor, not to point out tape-recorded.</p>

The essential difference with this bullet camera is it has a horizontal change which allows you to fine-tune the field of vision 1000% much better than a camera without a horizontal modification. No clue why more bullet cameras do not have this really essential feature. Also good metal building and construction. Had to hold the button down for 5 seconds to the left to get right mode not in white and black. Had to make the wire hole a little bigger to fit the huge choice gadget into the wall. Need to be a much better way to execute that. But it was just a little notch so not an offer breaker. Very good resolution - far better field of view vs the stock annke cameras and better clearness in the evening. Ideally these hold up over the years! Highly recommend.</p>
