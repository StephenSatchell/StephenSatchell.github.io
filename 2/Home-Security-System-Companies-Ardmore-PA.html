<h3>Home Window Security in Ardmore PA</h3>

I Would definitely purchase from cctvsecuritypros again. I highly suggest this company. The Nest Aware service is what makes this camera stand out-- it's what provides the video history and smarter notifies, for example. Nevertheless, those functions come at a comparatively high price: $5 monthly ($50 per year) for the first camera for 5 days of video history, $10 monthly ($100 each year) for 10 days of video history, or $30 monthly ($300 per year) for 30 days of video history.  For each extra camera, the subscription is marked down to about half of the initial cost.

<p>The Wisenet SmartCam N2 provides free advantages like person detection, familiar-face alerts, and local storage on a microSD card. (Cloud storage starts at $5 per month.) However, in our tests the familiar-face signals worked just about 50 percent of the camera and the time routinely disconnected from the network multiple times a day (when everything else on our network appeared fine).
