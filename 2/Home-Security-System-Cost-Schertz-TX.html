The Arlo Pro 2 is also the only cord-free 1080p camera on our list that offers seven days of complimentary cloud storage (with more readily available for a regular monthly cost ). Nevertheless, the camera will reset the sensor in between recordings, which Arlo says will enable the camera to appropriately detect motion and not get stuck recording on a loop. That also conserves battery life, however it may leave you with recording gaps during essential security events. If home security is your primary issue, we 'd advise one of our top choices, but the Arlo is fantastic for signing in on household and pets-- or stray cats slinking around your yard.</p>
