The Wyze Webcam can likewise record video to the cloud, but the complimentary account is restricted to 12-second clips every 5 minutes. That implies the camera will wait 5 minutes before it's able to tape-record once again, which suggests you may be missing out on a lot. Wyze's recently released Complete Motion Capture resolves this problem for $1.50 monthly per camera. It enables recording of all motion the camera senses, for as much as five minutes in a row. If motion continues beyond that window, the camera ends one clip and quickly begins another, without any gaps in between.
