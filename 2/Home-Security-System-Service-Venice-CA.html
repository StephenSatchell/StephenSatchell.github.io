<p>The Google Nest Webcam IQ Outdoor is the most technologically advanced outdoor camera we have actually tested. It has a close-up tracking function, which immediately focuses on motion and after that follows it around the field of vision. To make those images clear, it has an 8-megapixel 4K sensing unit, HDR (high vibrant variety), and 12 x digital zoom. It can distinguish between basic motion and individuals, so it reduces incorrect alarms, and it can even recognize individuals you have actually identified (after a knowing duration). However like all Nest cameras, this one needs the Nest Aware service to do anything beyond live viewing.</p>
<p>For new systems, the majority of customers utilize all HD cameras. These DVRs are excellent for those customers too due to the fact that every channel supports video recording at any resolution (D1, 960H, 720p, 1080p, 5MP).

(The remainder of the equipment is monitored by Brinks Home Security.)

This suggests the 720 ° camera has far less resolution per square inch; it is beginning with the same image sensor, 10MP in this case, though it needs to spread out that image across a far larger area and therefore will not look as crisp of a camera that just has a 130 ° field of view.</p>
