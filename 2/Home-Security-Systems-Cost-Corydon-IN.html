These security cameras connect to a user's home wifi network and allows that user to see the footage from anywhere. A common mistaken belief is that wireless implies the camera is wire-free. This is not the case as wireless cameras might still require a power cable. Wired security cameras are connected to a recorder directly which then links to a router and the internet.

As far as anyone is concerned, the image looks entirely typical given that the doorway and space seem at the exact same brightness level. As a result, faces are correctly exposed at the door and in the shop, achieving the objective of catching video of everybody going into the store. HDR is now a standard function in commercial cameras. Sadly, once customers realize that the inexpensive consumer camera they bought is lacking HDR, it's normally far too late given that the cameras and recorders are installed.</p>
