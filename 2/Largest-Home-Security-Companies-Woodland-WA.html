<p>Aside from the name, ADT also has a wide range of security equipment to safeguard your home. And the system needs expert installation, so you do not need to stress over sticking sensing units on your doors backward or something. If you wish to exceed security cameras and select an entire alarm system, our Best Home Security Systems review evaluation will show you all the best options. Once expertly set up, it's truly the clever aspect that defines the Vivint Smart Home, with everything integrated into an easy to manage system.

<p>The motion detection is excellent, and the app is a pleasure to use also (a lot much better than the apps you get with some spending plan security cameras), though if you wish to get into its cleverest customisations, there is a bit of a knowing curve. For all the more basic smarts, it's great, though.

<p>Neither the light nor the camera is particularly impressive on its own. The Maximus Smart Security Light camera is HD, but it's only 720p-- and we're starting to anticipate 1080p, if not 4K, from the security camera market. With that said, we would not recommend this system to tech-lovers, as we think the features are a little too basic. For instance, we would have liked to see an outdoor camera and more clever home features. But if simple DIY installation, no-contracts, and low-cost monitoring is your thing, we believe you'll like SimpliSafe.</p>
