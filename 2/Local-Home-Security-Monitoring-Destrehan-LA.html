<p>The Arlo Pro 3 is not terrific but good-- and so it isn't worth paying twice the price of its predecessor. When the 2 are compared side by side, the Arlo Pro 3 does edge out the Pro 2 on battery life and image, with 2K HDR video that is sharper during day and nighttime watching. However, color night vision image quality is frustrating, and the motion tracking function is a bit wonky. Likewise, the Pro 3 uses no free storage, and external storage can't be seen through the app, only by means of a computer. We will keep monitoring the Arlo Pro 3, however for now, we still think the Arlo Pro 2 is a much better buy. Both are still much better than the costly Arlo Ultra, which we found to have awful night-vision performance, bad battery life, and a propensity to miss far a lot of motion activates.</p>

Without a paid Circle Safe membership, you'll get more signals, which you can only filter to get every minute, 15 minutes, or 30 minutes. When utilized in high-traffic areas, the membership is more beneficial. Otherwise, the Smart Location feature can be set to disable recording when you're home-- to prevent informs whenever you stroll by. Unusually, though the app supports several users, its geofencing applies to each user separately, so if everybody in your family has the Circle app set up, you'll still get notifications when other individuals are home.</p>
