<h3>Security Alarm Equipment Sneads Ferry NC 28460</h3>
<p>There are 2 main types of cameras that can be wired into a video surveillance system: web procedure (IP) cameras and the standard analog cameras.

The Maximus Smart Security Light camera is HD, however it's just 720p-- and we're beginning to anticipate 1080p, if not 4K, from the security camera market.
