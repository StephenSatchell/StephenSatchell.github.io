<p>I simply finished updating all of my stock annke cameras with this design. The crucial distinction with this bullet camera is it has a horizontal adjustment which enables you to fine-tune the field of vision 1000% much better than a camera without a horizontal modification. No hint why more bullet cameras do not have this extremely crucial feature. Likewise nice metal building.

Need to be a better method to carry out that. But it was simply a little notch so not an offer breaker.
