<p>The Nest Webcam IQ Outdoor streams 1080p video with the exact same membership model and very same app as the original Nest Camera Outdoor, but it adds in more-detailed person detection, a brighter image, an automated close-up tracking feature (which follows a person around the seeing location), better audio, a more powerful mount, and a broader operating temperature level range (-40 degrees Fahrenheit to 113 degrees Fahrenheit). It's also more tamper-proof than any of our other choices, but that included security makes for a trickier installation procedure, and it costs almost two times the cost of the Nest Web Cam Outdoor.</p>
