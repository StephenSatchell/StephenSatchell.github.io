<p>I just ended up updating all of my stock annke cameras with this design. The essential distinction with this bullet camera is it has a horizontal change which enables you to fine-tune the field of view 1000% much better than a camera without a horizontal adjustment. No hint why more bullet cameras do not have this very important function. Also great metal construction. Needed to hold the button down for 5 seconds to the left to get appropriate mode not in white and black. Needed to make the wire hole a little bigger to fit the huge choice device into the wall. Must be a much better way to implement that. However it was just a little notch so not an offer breaker. Excellent resolution - far better field of vision vs the stock annke cameras and much better clarity at night. Hopefully these hold up throughout the years! Highly recommend.</p>
