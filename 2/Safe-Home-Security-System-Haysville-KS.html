Tech is supposed to make our lives much easier and Hive's ecosystem measures up to that. It's all the function without any disappointment.</p>

<p>Another crucial topic to talk about is camera resolution. It can be confusing to comprehend how much is enough.

The exact same is true of high-resolution TV sets, and the 2 most popular TV resolutions today are 1080p and 4K. 4K resolution contains about four times as much photo information as 1080p. Surveillance cameras are likewise made in these two resolutions, and it would be natural to believe that the more dots in your video image the better, right? Yes and no. There are some difficult effects to having such a high-resolution 4K image when it comes to surveillance cameras. In this case, more is not constantly much better.</p>
