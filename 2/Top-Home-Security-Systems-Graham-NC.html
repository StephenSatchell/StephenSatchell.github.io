<p>Dependability has long been at the heart of the dispute over hardwired versus wireless home security systems. It's an argument that's frequently skewed by elements such as skepticism over the susceptibility of wireless systems, including disturbance from radio signals and problems that trigger incorrect alarms. While enhancements over the last few years have made the innovation more popular and robust (some systems today have their own unique wireless technology, which can't be interfered with by other signals), concerns continue over vulnerabilities that do not affect hardwired systems.</p>

You can usually fine-tune the camera's motion sensitivity to prevent incorrect alarms due to family pet activity or passing cars if the camera is near a window, and you can develop a schedule that turns the sensing units on and off throughout certain hours of the day.</p>

What you lose in resolution, especially at the edges of your field of view, you make up for in dependability.</p>

<p>The Arlo Pro 3 is not excellent but good-- therefore it isn't worth paying two times the cost of its predecessor. When the 2 are compared side by side, the Arlo Pro 3 does edge out the Pro 2 on battery life and image, with 2K HDR video that is sharper throughout day and nighttime viewing. Nevertheless, color night vision image quality is frustrating, and the motion tracking feature is a bit wonky. Likewise, the Pro 3 provides no complimentary storage, and external storage can't be seen through the app, just through a computer. We will keep monitoring the Arlo Pro 3, however for now, we still think the Arlo Pro 2 is a better buy. Both are still much better than the costly Arlo Ultra, which we discovered to have terrible night-vision efficiency, poor battery life, and a tendency to miss out on far a lot of motion activates.</p>
