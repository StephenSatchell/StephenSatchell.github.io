<p>ASecureLife's recommendation: ADT is ideal for you if you're trying to find tried and true. Go with the basic landline bundle if your area does not have dependable cell protection. You'll conserve some cash and be better with the dependability of your system. Otherwise, select the ADT Pulse + Video to get mobile access, live video view, and an equipment service warranty.

We have actually seen 1-year, all the method as much as 5-year contracts! On the other hand, we recommend contract-free systems if you do not want to sign on the dotted line and be locked into a long-term agreement (and who does?). Our choice: No contract.</p>
