<p>Unlike most other cameras we evaluated, the corded Circle 2 does not have level of sensitivity settings for motion detection (though the cordless design does ). Instead, you can filter event alerts just by high activity, days, or individual (the latter is readily available just with a paid Circle Safe subscription). Without a paid Circle Safe membership, you'll get more signals, which you can only filter to get every minute, 15 minutes, or thirty minutes. When used in high-traffic locations, the subscription is more beneficial. Otherwise, the Smart Area feature can be set to disable recording when you're home-- to avoid informs whenever you stroll by. Oddly, though the app supports multiple users, its geofencing applies to each user individually, so if everybody in your family has the Circle app installed, you'll still get notices when other people are home.</p>
