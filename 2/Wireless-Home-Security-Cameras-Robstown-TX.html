<p>The Alarm Systems & Intrusion Detection item category is a collection of news, product listings and other resources for security experts looking into Alarm Systems & Intrusion Detection products. We thought about both the TP-Link Kasa Spot (KC100) and the Kasa Camera (KC120) for one of our top spots. Nevertheless, neither design has geofencing, and the KC120 left gaps of up to 25 seconds in between recordings.

<p>IP cameras are much higher resolution, allowing audio and video surveillance to be sent over a network, with IP addresses appointed to each camera. More technical in nature, IP camera systems will likely take more know-how to setup, and usually cost more than analog cameras. All detectors and sensing units interact with a control board.

<p>Clients should set up their own equipment, but according to SimpliSafe, it normally takes less than 30 minutes.

<p>Flood lights are frequently used in conjunction with motion detectors. When sensing units identify motion, the lights brighten the surrounding location, which will permit you to see who is on your residential or commercial property and will possibly frighten intruders. Much better outdoor lighting also means a clearer video for any outside cameras you have. When choosing flood lights, consider the brightness and range the light shines. Flood lights can deter vandals or frighten them away, but as a single piece of equipment, they are more for your assurance than for home protection.</p>
