Reports from cellphone users can be quickly reviewed and acted on by Public Safety authorities.</p>

<p>This cool smart alarm has a motion detector and siren in one gadget.

We like that it also lets you understand when other alarms are going off, such as a smoke or CO2 detector. For a lot of homes, you'll need a number of Minuts throughout your home, which can get costly. It's also worth keeping in mind that it has to be set up on the ceiling (it only keeps an eye on for motion in the 25m squared listed below), which is fiddly.
