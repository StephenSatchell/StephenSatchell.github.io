This is one of the drawbacks of analog CCTV video surveillance, as the cable can be expensive and hard to install, specifically for larger camera networks, and those were cameras need to be placed in challenging locations.

When the two are compared side by side, the Arlo Pro 3 does edge out the Pro 2 on battery life and image, with 2K HDR video that is sharper during day and nighttime watching. Nevertheless, color night vision image quality is frustrating, and the motion tracking function is a bit wonky.

We will keep monitoring the Arlo Pro 3, however for now, we still believe the Arlo Pro 2 is a better buy.
