<p>Ahhh EZVIZ, the company that seems to make every effort to make a camera with the most tough setup known to male. Here's how it plays out: First you need to download the app and put in your e-mail address. Then you enter the WiFi information of the network you're attempting to connect to. Then the phone plays a screeching, electronic acoustic wave to the camera to transmit the WiFi details. (You need to play this at complete volume or it will not work). Windows smash, dogs wail, felines scream, babies weep. Not that you can hear; your ear drums will have burst in the very first 10 seconds. It doesn't work. And it never works.</p>
<p>This completely depends upon your house. If you have 15 doors and a million windows, then you'll require more sensors and equipment than someone who resides in a studio apartment.
